# Geometry
Geometry is one of the oldest branches of mathematics, it concerned with the properties of space such as 
distance, shape, size and relative positioning of figures. Euclidean geometry investigates of the fundamental
notion of points, lines and planes ...[Read More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry)
# Fundamental Objects of Geometry
The basic objects of geometry include the point, line and planes;
## Point 
A point is a primitive notion that models an exact location in space and has no length, width or thickness.
Points are the basic building blocks of every geometric figure, a point is represented in space as it spatial 
dimensions (x,y).
