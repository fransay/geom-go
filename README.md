# Geometry

Geometry is one of the oldest branches of mathematics, it concerned with the properties of space such as 
distance, shape, size and relative positioning of figures. A high level classification shall render the field
into two categories. They are euclidean geometry non-euclidean geometry. Euclidean geometry is primarily concerned
with the fundamental notion of points, lines and planes.Non-Euclidean is mostly concerned with the study of surfaces
which are not flat, straight lines are not usual in non-euclidean engagements. Non-euclidean geometry is absolutely 
practical in the measurement of distances on the surface of the earth :earth_africa: ...[Read More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry)

# Fundamental Objects of Geometry
The basic objects of geometry include the point, line and planes;
## Point 
A point is a primitive notion that models an exact location in space and has no length, width or thickness.
Points are the basic building blocks of every geometric figure, a point is represented in space by its spatial 
dimensions as (x,y).
### Properties
```
1. No width or thickness 
2. No length
3. No centroid
